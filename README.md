# ServerAddon

ServerAddon is a LabyMod addon that can be use to play sounds to the player, 
and coming soon to playing at locations.

If you will see a working example here https://github.com/ItzHoffe/LabyModSK/blob/main/src/main/java/dk/hoffe/labymodsk/TestCommand.java
And the sounds is .ogg and is small like under 100 kb
